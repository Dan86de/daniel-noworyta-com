Try not to depend on third-party code directly in your React app without proper consideration. Abstract the implementations away and use standardized types and interfaces internally. That will make maintenance and refactoring so much easier.

```ts
// utils/dateUtils.js
import { format, parseISO } from 'date-fns';

// Define types for better clarity
export type DateString = string;

export const formatDate = (
    date: DateString,
    dateFormat: string
  ): string => {
  const parsedDate = parseISO(date);
  return format(parsedDate, dateFormat);
};

// components/ExampleComponent.js
import React from 'react';
import { formatDate } from '../utils/dateUtils';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const date = '2025-06-29T12:16:00';

  const formattedDate = formatDate(
    date,
    'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss'
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Formatted Date: {formattedDate}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Try to keep most components dumb and pure. Centralize data loading and other impactful features. Reasoning about a larger app that has for example network requests or async code spread all over the tree is a nightmare.

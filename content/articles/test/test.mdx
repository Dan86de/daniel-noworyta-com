# MDX Formatting Examples

This article demonstrates various MDX formatting features that you can use in your content.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* in your content. You can also combine them like ***bold and italic***.

## Code Examples

Here's an example of inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, World!";`

And here's a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("MDX"));
```

## Lists

### Ordered List
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Unordered List
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

## Tables

Here's an example of a table:

| Feature | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Bold | Makes text bold | **Important** |
| Italic | Makes text italic | *Emphasis* |
| Code | Inline code | `const x = 1` |
| Link | Creates a hyperlink | [Google](https://google.com) |

## Blockquotes
